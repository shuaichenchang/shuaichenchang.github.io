I am an applied scientist at AWS AI Lab in New York. Before joining AWS, I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science Department at The Ohio State University, advised by Prof. [Eric Fosler-Lussier](https://efosler.github.io/). Prior to OSU, I obtained my B.S. at Fudan University, advised by Prof. [Xipeng Qiu](https://xpqiu.github.io/en.html).

## Research Interests

My research focuses on building robust and generalizable AI systems that interact with data and environments through natural language. My work spans several interconnected areas:

**Natural Language Interfaces to Data**: I develop methods for enabling natural language interaction with structured and semi-structured data, including text-to-SQL systems, table understanding, and database question answering. A significant focus of my work is on improving robustness and cross-domain generalization of these systems.

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: My team at AWS develops advanced RAG systems for production deployment, focusing on diagnostic evaluation frameworks and practical solutions for improving retrieval quality and generation faithfulness.

**Agentic AI and Computer-Use Agents**: I am actively working on building autonomous AI agents that can interact with computer environments, including developing retrieval-augmented world models for agent planning and automated composition frameworks for agentic systems.

**Table Representation Learning**: I work on instruction tuning for table understanding tasks and developing methods to improve model performance on structured data. I also co-organized the [Table Representation Learning workshop](https://table-representation-learning.github.io/ACL2025/) at ACL 2025.

**Robustness and Evaluation**: A core theme across my research is developing diagnostic benchmarks and evaluation frameworks to systematically assess model capabilities and failure modes, enabling more reliable AI systems.

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaborating or just chatting about AI, agents, or data-centric NLP!

## Miscs

In my spare time I enjoy tennis, painting ([Summer Lake](/images/painting1.jpg), [Fall](/images/painting2.jpg)), dancing, and traveling. I've stayed in Tianjin, Shanghai, Taipei, Columbus, San Jose, New York, and Honolulu for more than one month.
