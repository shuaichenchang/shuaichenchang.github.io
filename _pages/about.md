I am an AI researcher at the AWS AI Lab in New York and a founding member of the AWS Bedrock RAG and Agentic AI Science team. Before joining AWS, I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science Department at The Ohio State University, advised by Prof. [Eric Fosler-Lussier](https://efosler.github.io/). Prior to OSU, I obtained my B.S. at Fudan University, advised by Prof. [Xipeng Qiu](https://xpqiu.github.io/en.html).

## Research Interests

My research focuses on building robust and generalizable AI models and systems that interact with data and environments through natural language. My work spans several interconnected areas:

**Natural Language Interfaces to Data**: I develop methods for enabling natural language interaction with structured and semi-structured data, including text-to-SQL, table understanding, and database question answering. A significant focus of my work is on improving robustness and cross-domain generalization of these models and systems.

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: I develop advanced RAG solutions focusing on heterogeneous data retrieval, agentic retrieval, and diagnostic evaluation frameworks.

**Agentic AI and Computer-Use Agents**: I am actively working on building autonomous agents that interact with computer environments and orchestrate complex workflows. My recent work includes retrieval-augmented world models for agent planning and automated frameworks for composing agent systems.

**Table Representation Learning**: I work on instruction tuning for table understanding tasks and developing methods to improve model performance on structured data. I also co-organized the [Table Representation Learning workshop](https://table-representation-learning.github.io/ACL2025/) at ACL 2025.

**Robustness and Evaluation**: A core theme across my research is developing diagnostic benchmarks and evaluation frameworks to systematically assess model capabilities and failure modes, enabling more reliable AI systems.

## Miscs

In my spare time I enjoy tennis, painting ([Summer Lake](/images/painting1.jpg), [Fall](/images/painting2.jpg)), dancing, and traveling. I've stayed in Tianjin, Shanghai, Taipei, Columbus, San Jose, New York, and Honolulu for more than one month.
