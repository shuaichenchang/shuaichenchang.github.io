This blog post provides a summary of our paper "Dr.Spider: A Diagnostic Evaluation Benchmark towards Text-to-SQL Robustness,".

## Paper Overview

Dr.Spider is a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation benchmark designed to assess the robustness of Text-to-SQL models. The benchmark includes various perturbation types that test different aspects of model robustness, helping researchers understand where their models succeed and where they fail.
